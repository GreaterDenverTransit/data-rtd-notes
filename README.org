#+title: Readme

Notes taken during working sessions. Notes are taken as org files (https://orgmode.org/) and then transpiled to LaTeX (https://www.latex-project.org/) which is then exported to PDF. The original org files are included but for most folks the ~pdf~ directory (which contains the exported PDFs) is likely the only place to look for notes.
